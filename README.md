### Hi there 👋

My name is **Yuliang Zhong** and I am currently a master's student in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH Zürich . I graduated with honors in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). 

My passion lies in making robots 🤖️ show intelligence and perform well in complex environments. My interests range from robot planning to control, including **decision making** 🤯 , **path/motion planning** 👣 , and **optimal control** ⚙️ of autonomous systems.

I am dedicated to building my robotic toolbox 🧰 and have taken deep and comprehensive classes in robot dynamics, machine learning, path planning, and model predictive control at ETH. I am proficient in modern **C++**, **python/Pytorch**, **Matlab/Simulink** and **ROS1/2**.

I am a self-motivated individual with a great curiosity for new knowledge and a meticulous and reliable approach to my work. I am not only a fast learner, but also skilled at organizing and summarizing information. So excited I am to see where my passion for robotics takes me in the future 😄 !
